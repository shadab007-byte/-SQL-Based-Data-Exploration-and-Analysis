# SQL-Based Data Exploration and Analysis

This repository contains a project that demonstrates SQL-based data exploration and manipulation using an in-memory SQLite database. The project focuses on creating schemas, inserting data, and performing various SQL queries to analyze and extract insights from the data.

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**
This project is designed to showcase the use of SQL for:
- Database design and schema creation.
- Data insertion and management.
- Querying data using filtering, joins, and aggregations.
- Advanced SQL techniques such as window functions and optimizations.

The project uses an **in-memory SQLite database** to make it lightweight and easy to replicate.

## 🛠️ **Key Features**
1. **Database Design**:
   - Created tables for a Student Management System (`students`, `courses`, `enrollments`).
   - Defined relationships using primary and foreign keys.

2. **Data Insertion**:
   - Inserted sample data into tables for students, courses, and enrollments.

3. **SQL Queries**:
   - Performed filtering, joins, and aggregations to answer questions about the data.
   - Used window functions to rank salaries in an employee dataset.
   - Explored customer spending patterns in a retail dataset.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzed relationships between students, courses, and enrollments.
   - Extracted insights about customer demographics, spending scores, and product prices.

## 📂 **Files in the Repository**
1. **`SQL-Based Data Exploration and Analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to create an SQLite in-memory database, insert data, and execute SQL queries.
2. **Sample Datasets**:
   - The datasets are created programmatically within the notebook (no external files are required).

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository:https://github.com/shadab007-byte/SQL-Based-Student-Management-System
   
2. Run the cells in sequence to:
- Create an in-memory SQLite database.
- Define schemas for tables (`students`, `courses`, `enrollments`).
- Insert sample data into the tables.
- Perform SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.

---

## 🧰 **Dependencies**
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `sqlite3`: For creating and managing the SQLite database.
- `pandas`: For displaying query outputs in tabular format.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with these libraries.

---

## 📊 **Sample Queries**
Here are some examples of queries included in this project:

1. **Join Query**: Find all students enrolled in "Machine Learning" courses.
2. **Aggregation Query**: Calculate the average age of students enrolled in each course.
3. **Window Function**: Rank employees by salary within their department.
4. **Filtering Query**: Retrieve customers with a spending score above 80.

---

## ✨ **Highlights**
- Lightweight implementation using an in-memory SQLite database.
- Covers essential SQL concepts like schema design, joins, filtering, aggregations, and window functions.
- Demonstrates integration of Python with SQL for seamless analysis.
